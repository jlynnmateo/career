	   <p>A pharmacist is a person who gives out medications to patients that are 
	   prescribed by their physicians. They also help the doctor be aware of all the facts
	   they would need to know about the medication. Some facts would be about the amount
	   of dosages, or the side effects that could happen. Pharmacists can identify the 
	   medication by their biological, chemical, and physical properties. Their goal is to 
	   increase positive health care results and improve a patients' quality of life with
	   minimum health risks.</p>
