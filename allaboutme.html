  <h1>All About Me</h1>
<br />

<p>I was not really sure what I wanted to be when I was little. I could not find anything 
that was really interesting to me. It wasn't until eighth grade that I found out that I was 
really intersted in science. Learning about the biological and chemical properties of a 
substance was really interesting. This is why I wanted to be a pharmacist because their 
job is to know all the biological, physical, and chemical properties of medicines.</p>
